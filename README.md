# Crank Lab

A browser build-fight practice range: Chapter 1-style movement, turbo build, wall / floor / ramp / cone edits, and fully custom keybinds (mouse side buttons and scroll wheel included).

**Play:** https://abarber206.github.io/crank-lab/

## Opponent
A bot that strafes, shoots, walls up when hit, ramp rushes when you take height, and boxes up to peek through window edits. On **Adaptive** it measures your accuracy, build speed, edits and damage over the last 40 seconds and matches it, nudging harder when you win rounds and easier when you lose. Fixed Easy to Expert levels are in the menu. The bot is off while you're in a multiplayer room.

## Multiplayer
Open the menu, type a name, and press **Host a room**. Share the 5-letter code; friends press **Join** with it. Up to 8 players.

Multiplayer is peer-to-peer (WebRTC via [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com)). The host's game relays movement and every build, edit and break, so the room closes when the host leaves. No server to run.
